# Make School Institutional Plan

*Staff project owner: Ashu Desai (Founder)*

The May 2020 update is v1.1 of our Institutional Plan github. Our intention with this github is to create transparent documentation of Make School's "feature set" and future plans. We will use this repository in conjunction with our release cycle process (see "Institutional Planning Process") to provide regular updates to students and prospective students about how Make School is iterating and adapting.

We hope this creates more transparency and better information communication primarily with the student body and secondarily with the broader community. We also hope the github repository serves as a forum - alongside town-halls and feedback surveys - for students to contribute to the vision and development of our institution, an open-source, collaboratively built university.

It is an experiment for a college to provide documentation and allow for discussion in the format of a software project. We will learn along the way what works, what doesn't, and how to communicate more clearly and more efficiently. We hope by doing this we can hold ourselves to a higher standard of transparency, communication, and collaboration with our students, staff, prospective students, and broader community.

Our next update will be released in late summer. Stay tuned!

## Tracking Issues and Updates:

Student council is establishing a way to create and track issues on the institutional plan to allow for discussion of various aspects of Make School. Please review the contributing guidelines here:

## May 2020 General Update:

Dear Make School community - 2020 is off to a fast start. We are grateful that California is finding success in the battle against COVID-19 while recognizing that much of the world is not as fortunate.

We are expecting to be back on campus this fall, though will continue to offer a fully remote learning option for students who need it. We're excited to be with you in person again!

Our team has been heads down preparing for the site visit with our accreditor that happened last week (May 5-7th), so our general org updates are a bit lighter this cycle. We will be sharing more information about the accreditation process and general updates soon.

Best,
The Make School Team

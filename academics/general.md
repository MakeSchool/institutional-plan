### Community
Make School is committed to recruiting and supporting students from diverse backgrounds that are historically underrepresented in technical careers. This fall we welcomed 107 new juniors along with 102 returning seniors and 28 super seniors for a total student body of 237 students. Enrollment and demographic data is published on our [website](https://www.makeschool.com/computer-science-degree/outcomes/data).   

The **Make School Student Life Team** is dedicated to building and maintaining a thriving community through coaching, events, mental health support, student clubs and much more.  See full details on the *Student Life Pages*

### Curriculum  

Our Bachelor of Science in Applied Computer Science program consists of courses in the categories of Software Product Development, Technical Curriculum in one of four concentrations (Front End Web, Back End Web, Data Science, Mobile), and Science and Letters curriculum.  See the Computer Science and Science and Letters pages for more details.

- **Software Product Development Curriculum includes:**
  - **Software Product Development Term Courses (SPD)** are project focused courses where students integrate the content from technical courses and learn valuable career skills. These courses are offered and must be taken every term.
  - **Intensives (INT)** are one to two week long immersive courses where students work individually or on teams to build products.  Intensives are offered in between terms three times a year in Fall, Winter and Spring
  - **Supervised Work Experience (SWE)** is a semester long internship with an industry partner. Students must apply for these positions at verified companies and are mentored by the company.  These are often paid positions.
- **Technical Curriculum includes:**
  - **Foundational Curriculum:**  Computer Science: CS 1.0, CS 1.1, and CS 1.2, and Full Stack Web: WEB 1.0 and WEB 1.1.
  - **Concentration Curriculum:**  There are four concentrations: Back End Web (BEW), Front End Web (FEW), Mobile (MOB), Data Science (DS). Students will take 6 courses in their concentration.  Students can choose not to have a concentration and take 6 additional technical electives.
  - **Electives:** Courses chosen from any concentration, advanced CS (CS 1.3, CS 2.1, CS 2.2), independent studies, and advanced technical seminars.
- **Science & Letters Curriculum includes:**
  - Courses covering a broad spectrum of learning in writing, quantitative literacy, science and social science.  These courses are often offered over a semester (two terms).   See more in the Science & Letters Section.

### Course Delivery: Our Approach to Learning:
Make School uses project based, hands-on, and active learning in all classes. Students learn product development through building software designed to impact real problems. Students learn the same technologies, frameworks and design process used by tech companies.  Class sessions include some lecture sessions to set learning context, but are primarily guided working sessions where students work solo or in groups with guidance and feedback from the instructors and TAs.  In an online setting, guided sessions are facilitated through software that allows for easy transition between full class, small group and 1:1 support.  Our instructors continue to experiment with innovative approaches to learning in an online setting.


### Faculty:
Make School faculty have a background in both strong teaching and relevant industry experience.  Our technical faculty have worked as software engineers at major tech companies, built software startups and contributed to recent research and software platforms in their fields.  

Our faculty / student ratio is 1 / 18 with an average class size of 20.  Each class has additional support from Teaching Assistants, Curriculum Developers, and guest sessions from industry professionals.

For the 2021 school year we have 11 full-time technical faculty, 2 full-time S&L faculty and 7 part-time S&L faculty.

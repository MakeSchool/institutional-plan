### S&L Framework

*   The framework of the S&L courses fall into the three categories of Self, Community, and World.  Each category strives to build out a different skill set and understanding of a personâ€™s life in relation to technology, and the world around them.  Our courses will focus on advancing the skills of quantitative literacy, critical thinking, communication, and information literacy.  As the Tech industry, economy, and world transforms, our S&L framework aims to adapt and evolve, in order to adequately prepare our students for success.

**Course Research**

*   As we build out our new General Education requirements we will be conducting interviews with leaders in the Tech industry to get a better understanding of industry needs. We will also take into consideration student course evaluations as we continue to create the S&L curriculum.  It is important for students to give us midterm and final feedback on courses so that we can determine the utility of the courses and their curriculum.  

**New Courses for Spring 2021**

*   Make School will be offering three new courses this Spring:
    *   **Technology and Equity:** This course will investigate the relevance of gender, race, and sexuality to understanding technology and the development of new technologies.
    *   **Microeconomics and Personal Finance:** This course constructs the beginning of a strong foundation of economics and personal finance in order to empower students to function effectively as consumers, workers, investors, entrepreneurs, and active citizens.  
    *   **Ethics and Society: **This course will explore the ethical complexities of information and communication technology in relation to humankind.

**Hiring for Spring 2021**

*   We are currently hiring two adjunct instructors to teach Ethics and Microeconomics. Selected students will be given an opportunity to participate in sample teaching from the candidates during our hiring process.

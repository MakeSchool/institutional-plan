# December 2020 Updates

## Curriculum
- We are conducting Track reviews at the end of Term 2 to evaluate any course changes needed to better meet student learning needs and current industry standards. 
- We have updated Term 3 offerings to include more technical and S&L courses.  See the current list of courses on make.sc/course-schedule or in your Term 3 registration. 
- We are moving more of the outcomes related instruction into technical and SPD courses to provide students more support and accountability in completing this work that is vital to securing an internship and job post graduation.  Curriculum like technical interview practice and building your portfolio will now be emphasized more within courses as well as in specific outcomes programming. 


## Delivery
For Fall 2021, we will be offering the BACS program in two different formats: On Campus in San Francisco, and Online. We are in the process of finalizing the details of online delivery, but are sharing what we know so far in the name of transparency. 

Industry norms have shifted significantly, and remote work is likely to figure prominently in post pandemic tech life. Meetings will often include both in-person and remote employees in the same meeting given that many tech employees have shifted to permanent remote work. Showing up to the office from 9-5, 5 days a week is less likely to be the daily norm, with the office used as a collaborative workspace and for social events. Make School program changes for next year are inspired by this industry shift. 

We welcome your feedback and questions and we finalize our online offering. 

**Please fill out this survey [make.sc/bacs2021-survey](https://make.sc/bacs2021-survey) and post questions in the #bacs2021 slack channel.**

### Details: 

Students will attend the program either On Campus in San Francisco or Online.  
- The On Campus experience is available for students who are living in the SF area and can be on campus at 555 Post St. from 9:30 - 5:30 PST M-F.  
- The Online experience is offered for students who can live anywhere and will not access the SF campus at any time. These students will be online from 9:30 - 5:30 PST M-F.  

The primary difference between these two options will come in orientation, courses, and career support. 

### Orientation
If it is safe to do so, Fall 2021 orientation will be held at the end of August in San Francisco. All On Campus and Onsite students will be invited to participate in a 3 day orientation. Attendance will be highly recommended but not mandatory for Online students. 

### Courses
All courses will continue to use project based, active learning to provide the highest quality learning experience and mirror industry practices. Courses consist of four major components; lectures, guided work time, group work and frequent feedback on your work and learning process. 
    
**Lectures:** The purpose of the lecture is to give students the opportunity to learn from our facultyâ€™s industry expertise. The lecture portion of a course provides the motivation and context for the topic to be explored.
- Make School is investing in high quality, pre-recorded video to augment lectures, with the goal of further shifting lecture time to an asynchronous model where students can listen to the lecture on their own time and the time with the course instructor can be dedicated to guided active learning, discussion, and live Q&A. 
- All lectures will be delivered online whether you are an On Campus or Online student. 
- Some lectures may be recorded from a classroom in SF, so On Campus may have the option of attending certain classes in person that are simultaneously being attended by Online students streaming the same class. This will be confirmed at the time course registration opens for next fall. 
- The SF campus will be reconfigured to support students tuning into online lectures in groups.
- On Campus students will also have the flexibility of attending lectures from their dorms or housing if they prefer.  

**Guided Work Time (Lab):** Provides the opportunity to learn while building projects and working on real world applications of concepts. Students work on class projects with support from a mix of senior student TAs, professional TAs that have worked in the industry, and class instructors. 
On Campus students will have access to in-person and online guided support.
- Online students will have guided support through scheduled zoom room time with TAs, 1:1 office hours and always open online forums like Discourse.
- Unlike lectures, labs will often (but not always) be grouped by modality. On Campus students will have in-person lab sections with other On Campus students, Online students will have online sections with other Online students. Sometimes, small class sizes may require us to blend lab sections with On Campus and Online students. 

**Group Work:**  Group project work allows students to learn from each other and learn how to operate on a team. 
- Unlike lectures, group work will often (but not always) be grouped by modality. On Campus students will be placed on teams with other On Campus students, Online students will be placed on teams with other Online students. Sometimes, small class sizes may require us to create hybrid teams with Online and On Campus students.

**Feedback:** Feedback is vital to the learning process and a major part of the Make School pedagogy.   
- Feedback on coursework is provided asynchronously through rubrics, automated testing of programs, written comments from instructors and TAs.
- Students will often present work through formal presentations or technical interview formats and receive live feedback.  These may be online or in-person.
- Student portfolio projects are reviewed asynchronously and then in 1:1 conversations with instructors and other experts. 

### Career Support
Career support at Make School is provided through dedicated outcomes staff, outcomes events, and industry guest speakers.
- Meetings with career support staff will occur on campus for On Campus students and online for Online students. 
- All industry guest speakers will be available to stream online and Online students will have the same opportunity to ask questions as On Campus students. Some may come in to the SF campus to speak, others may be fully online
- Career fairs will be held in two different formats:
  - Online career fairs will use Spatial Chat and our proprietary online demo infrastructure and will target employers hiring remotely. 
  - On Campus career fairs will happen in SF and target employers hiring locally.
  Online students are invited to fly to SF to participate in the On Campus career fairs if they prefer. Dates are announced at the start of the school year.
- Field trips to partner companies will only be offered to On Campus students

### YOUR INPUT WANTED

# October 2020 Updates

## Curriculum

Course schedule changes:

The schedule for when classes are offered each term is determined based on the hours the class needs to be in session (5.5 hours per week for a 3 unit course in 7 weeks) and optimizing for student, instructor, community schedules. The list of courses offered each term is determined on a year to year basis and published here: [make.sc/course-schedule](https://make.sc/course-schedule). Each term, we evaluate if any additional courses are needed for our students and (when possible) offer these courses as well. Occasionally a course that doesn't have enough enrollment will be moved to a later term.

Course changes:

For fall 2020, we updated our foundational curriculum to include CS 1.0 Introduction to Programming and WEB 1.0 Web Fundamentals to provide a better onboarding into our program for students with no previous programming experience. High pass rates in Term 1 indicate this was a successful change that will increase student success.

## Delivery
We are currently committed to delivering all courses online through the end of Term 4 (May 13, 2021) to support 
student safety during the ongoing pandemic. We are exploring having some online modalities available after the pandemic and will provide updates on a regular basis.

## Faculty
One of our Data Science Instructors is leaving Make School at the end of Term 1 so we currently have two open roles in our technical faculty.
- Data Science Instructor
- Full Stack Web Instructor  

We have increased the number of TAs available in classes to support while we search for new instructors.  We anticipate filling these roles soon.

## April 2021 Updates
In alignment with Make School competitors and from feedback from our Employer Partners, the Outcomes Program will be rebranded to Career Services. This name change will not affect any programmatic responsibilities or ownership. It is just a change in name. 

In partnership with finance, Career services will start to implement Graduation Exist Interviews where students will get a better understanding of what Career Services looks like post graduation and how to best partner with the Director of Career Services. This also gives them a chance to ask questions and to fully be aware of the terms of their ISA. 

In term 3 in partnership with Student Experience hosted 2 days of Career Services Support days. Students went through vigorous professional development training that totaled over 12 hours in the end. Students walked away with a better understanding of: Handshake, Hireflow
Behavioral Interviews, Financial literacy, Social Media and your job search , and heard from a variety of women leaders in tech to celebrate women's history month. 

In term 4 Career Services hosted Make Schools first virtual career fair. Over 10 companies were in attendance and roughly 100 students participated. This has resulted in a number of students scheduling initial interviews. 

In terms 3 and 4 we saw a combined increase of 10% in our employment outcomes and are on track with our Spring graduates. We also saw an increase of 18,000 dollars in graduate starting salaries from February to March. 

Continuing into Term 5, Career Services will be evaluating student portfolios in conjunction with academics. Our Industry Advisory Committee will be reviewing and scoring student portfolios as well as providing feedback.

# Campus Plan

*Staff area owner and author: Eric Deng (Director of Finance and Operations)*

Due to COVID-19 and initial shelter-in-place orders that were in effect for the City and County of San Francisco, construction in the building was paused in March, and remains paused at the time of this update.

We are following the city's updates for re-opening closely, and we are currently planning to identify what changes need to be made to our building to facilitate a return to the building in Summer or Fall 2021, if allowed by local authorities.

We are also following updates from the scientific community, including the development of on-site rapid testing and vaccines to help facilitate a safe return to campus.

The [“Emergency” page on our website](https://www.makeschool.com/computer-science-degree/tuition-and-aid) allows students, staff, and their families to receive updates on emergencies that may impact our campus, including our campus housing. All community members are encouraged to [sign up for our text alert system](https://mobile-text-alerts.com/subscribe/MakeSchoolAlert), in which they can receive real-time emergency and security updates.

**Security at Campus - Pre-Pandemic - (555 Post Street, San Francisco):**

Safety is important to us. When on campus, all students and staff members use an ID card to badge into the building. This ensures that everyone walking in is part of our community and we are able to visually identify who enters.

Guests visiting campus can press the doorbell (located directly next to the door) and their contact will let them in the building. They will then sign in using an iPad so that a log of visitors can be kept.

We have a Security Guard as another means of safety precautions to not only greet folks as they walk in, but to also ensure anyone within the radius of the front door of Make School who enters is invited to do so.

On an annual basis, we will train all staff & new hires on our security and emergency protocols, including how to respond to security breaches.

### Community Offerings Fall 2020

We know, the pandemic stinks. 

But community will be our air freshener or smooth deodorant to overcome the isolation. We can fight the smell together! Community has become one of the most important metrics for the college given that our program is currently remote.

Here’s what’s up.

Community building during term 1:
* **Small Group Hangouts**: Deep Connection your Maker Hub group, mentioned above, will be a place to hear the life story of 10 other teammates. You’ll start and end your week with this group, reflecting on how you can improve. We learn better together than alone.
* **In-class community**: Energizers instructors often start class with a quick “breakout” activity in groups of 4-5. These might be “share a fun fact about where you grew up or” “show your partners your favorite app. These allow you to connect with a wide variety of friends around different topics.
* **Peer mentors**: some senior students have volunteered to mentor incoming juniors. Keep an eye out - they will be recruiting mentees during orientation!
* **Coaching**: each student will connect with a “coach.” This is a one-on-one personal relationship outside the classroom. The coach is your go-to person if you feel lost and a confidant as you face challenges. They work for you!

What’s that … you want MORE community? Alright then …

* **Async community**: the Slack communication platform is a place to connect too! Channels like #random #medium-mafia #help-with-code more surprises coming along. You’ll also see lots of staff members posting their profiles and students posting too.
* **Events**: keep an eye out for a series of student led and staff led events. We have game nights, social justice dialogues, guest speakers. Get pumped!! You can host something too. Student council may have some tricks up their sleeves too.
* **Student Clubs**: Starting Term 2, students have the opportunity to lead their own clubs, events, and social gatherings. These might include a gaming hangout or contest, and “art night,” or pitch event.
* **Student Committees**: Three student led committees exist to foster stronger community. These include the Friendship Committee, The JEDI committee (Justice, Equity, Diversity, Inclusion), and Student Council. These groups create events and initiatives to forward their respective committee's purpose. Reach out to Megan Dias (contact below) if you are interested in joining one of these committees!
* **Student Resource Groups (SRGs)**: these optional peer-groups are organized around identities: LGBTQIA, Students of Color, ADHD, Veterans, etc. These model “employee resource groups” in industry and strive to create affinity, belonging, and support.
* **Productivity and Wellness Practice Groups**: All juniors took a success skills survey. Dan asked seniors if they wanted to lead a "practice group" every two weeks on topics of biggest need. These include Productivity, Study Skills, Diet and Exercise, Asking for Help, Crushing Negative Thinking. This is a big win as it takes organizing burden off staff, helps seniors gain leadership skills.
* **Teaching assistants**: each class has a teaching assistant, someone who knows the material and can help unblock you when you are stuck. These are often senior students who have already completed the class.
* **Cowork**: this is a coworking session where you can meet with teaching assistants and instructors to get work on your projects
Student Experience Team: The student experience team is entirely dedicated to ensuring you enjoy your time at Make School. Reach out to them to give feedback on the program or talk about your personal desires for your experience.

We did it! No more smell.

Remember to shower every day. 6 feet distance. Don’t touch your hands, face ….

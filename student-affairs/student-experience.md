# Student Experience

*Staff area owner and author: Megan Dias (Student Experience Manager)*

_The Student Experience section covers all student facing programs, initiatives, and events owned and executed by the Student Experience Team (Megan, Lisa, Valdine)._

### **[School-wide Events:](https://docs.makeschool.com/institutional-plan/?mc_cid=0969df180a&mc_eid=101923c956#/student-affairs/student-experience?id=school-wide-events)**

The Student Experience Team hosts various school-wide events throughout the year to enhance the community. Below are some of the key annual events all students participate in.

Orientation: Orientation occurs each August and welcomes new students (incoming juniors) and returning students (seniors). The goals of Orientation are: 1) Build a sense of community, 2) Acclimate juniors to Make School and college life, and 3) Encourage seniors to show up as leaders and mentors and reflect on what was learned over the course of the past year. At the end of the Orientation, we gather feedback via a survey to continue to enhance the program each year. In the future, we would like to have student Orientation Leaders help in the planning and execution of orientation sessions.

Graduation: We recognize our graduates via a Graduation Celebration to honor all of their accomplishments and achievements. This year, we’ve held 3 graduations via zoom, with our fourth graduation coming up on Saturday, May 15th, 2021. We invite current students, staff, alumni and families to attend. The celebration includes speeches from students and staff, as well as time to congratulate the graduates with special gifts and a toast.

Demo Night: This is an annual event typically hosted in April, with the goal of connecting students to industry professionals by having students showcase projects they’ve developed during the Intensive Week. In the past, Demo Night has resulted in students getting internships and job offers, as well as enhancing skill-sets such as communication and talking about how they built their technical project. 

Career Fair: In January 2020 we hosted our first ever Career Fair, where we invited 10+ companies to talk to students about open internships and jobs, as well as hosted speed mentoring, resume review, and interview practice. Students learned how to talk to recruiters, as well as enhance their understanding of hiring best practices. 

Term 4 Update: The Student Experience Team partnered with the Career Services Team to put together a Career Fair type event that occurred on April 12th. We will evaluate how this went and make changes and recommendations for future Career Fairs.

Student led Town Halls: In the past, we’ve held student-led Town Halls centered around a particular topic. These have been scheduled in response to Student Council requests or when determined necessary by the Dean and facilitated by Student Council members. Town Halls are scheduled ad hoc, and none are currently scheduled as of this time.


### **[Peer Mentors:](https://docs.makeschool.com/institutional-plan/?mc_cid=0969df180a&mc_eid=101923c956#/student-affairs/student-experience?id=peer-mentors)**

Peer Mentors consist of seniors mentoring juniors in various areas to enhance their overall experience. Both mentors and mentees apply to be part of the program. Mentorship categories are both technical and non-technical and include: helping with coding problems, being an International Student, scoping projects, goal setting, transitioning to Make School, being a Student of Color, and specific help based on individual concentration. Peer Mentors have 2-3 mentees and meet and/or chat frequently based on personal schedules. For questions regarding Peer Mentors, please contact [Lisa.tran@makeschool.com](mailto:Lisa.tran@makeschool.com).

In Term 3, the Peer Mentors conducted a mid-year program review to assess current state of the program and improvements for the future.  Lisa also met 1:1 with mentees to check-in on how mentorship has been going for them.  At the end of the term, Peer Mentors and mentees were invited to attend a Game Night to increase mentor/mentee bonding.

In Term 4 (April 19, 2021), there will be a student-led Peer Mentor panel where all juniors can ask questions to our senior Peer Mentors and receive advice on Make School, job/internship searching, etc.  At the end of the panel, Peer Mentors will also be hosting breakout rooms focused on various topics like job searching for international students, the industry collaboration project, and general job preparation tips. The goal of this event is to provide juniors and seniors with the opportunity to strengthen inter-class relationships and exchange tips/resources so that juniors are better prepared for their senior year. 


### **[Student Council:](https://docs.makeschool.com/institutional-plan/?mc_cid=0969df180a&mc_eid=101923c956#/student-affairs/student-experience?id=student-council)**

Student Council exists to be the voice of the student body to share concerns and suggestions on how to improve processes and the overall student experience. Each year, students are self-nominated and then voted in by their peers to act as a liaison between Make School students and staff. Student Council includes representatives from both the junior and senior class. For questions regarding Student Council, contact [Megan.dias@makeschool.com](mailto:Megan.dias@makeschool.com). \

The current initiative Student Council has been working on is Don Rags. These opt in feedback sessions allowed for students to walk away with actionable ways to continue to grow as students. Student Council sent out a feedback survey to participants that will be analyzed to determine the future of Don Rags.


### **[Event Coordinators:](https://docs.makeschool.com/institutional-plan/?mc_cid=0969df180a&mc_eid=101923c956#/student-affairs/student-experience?id=student-council)**

Event Coordinators: Students are invited to be Student Event Coordinators to plan events for all students to attend. Examples of past events include Trivia nights, movie nights, game nights, and Spirit Week. The Event Coordinators meet a few times a month and execute events they think the student body would be the most excited about. All students are invited to participate in the planning meetings and events! Check out our #event-coordinators slack channel if interested. For questions regarding Event Coordinators, reach out to [Lisa.tran@makeschool.com](mailto:Lisa.tran@makeschool.com).

In Term 3, the Student Event Coordinators hosted a movie night to de-stress before finals week.  They also helped with planning the #make-good channel--an initiative to encourage people to do some spring cleaning and donate unwanted items to communities in need. 

In Term 4, the Student Event Coordinators will host a game night, trivia night, Earth Day Art Competition, and help encourage students to attend club events (e.g., Gather Town with Homework Club, weekly Chess Club tournaments, Data Science Club meetings, Technical Interview Club meetings, etc.).


### **[Student Clubs:](https://docs.makeschool.com/institutional-plan/?mc_cid=0969df180a&mc_eid=101923c956#/student-affairs/student-experience?id=student-clubs)**

Students are encouraged to create and lead their own interest-based clubs as a way for them to connect outside of the classroom. This also creates opportunities for students to develop their leadership skills. Club registration opens at the beginning of each term. For more information on clubs, check out the [Clubs Program Structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12PJfcOiU1pjHkHi8YVIWDUXUVeBtnqQx5t2tf3--7Mo/edit?usp=sharing). A full list of active clubs can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yLftM-3lk9ptSEhuttc8PiDu5KYZju2IW7s6oPSvnlU/edit?usp=sharing). For questions regarding clubs, please reach out to Lisa.tran@makeschool.com.


In Term 3, the Club Leaders participated in a Club Fair where they introduced the student community to various clubs and student groups their peers could get involved with.  This term we’ve brought back the Data Science Club and the Technical Interview Club. 

At the end of Term 3, the Data Science Club began meeting and invited a Make School DS alumni to discuss experience in the industry and share job/internship searching tips.  The Chess Club has also been hosting weekly Chess tournaments on Sunday. 

At the end of Term 3, the Black Student Club began meetings with external and internal industry leaders and professionals to share job/internship searching tips. Students met with Googlers and Make School staff to share advice on how to job search strategically.

### **[Coaching:](https://docs.makeschool.com/institutional-plan/?mc_cid=0969df180a&mc_eid=101923c956#/student-affairs/student-experience?id=coaching)**

Coaching is designed to support students through building 1:1 connections with staff. Coaches provide guidance, accountability, and mentorship for students as they progress through Make School’s program. Each student selects a coach and meets with their coach 1:1 throughout their time at Make School at least twice per each 7 week term. Coaching is meant to be non-technical support and success is measured by end of term feedback surveys. 

We are currently in the process of conducting opt in Coaching Focus Groups for juniors and seniors to share feedback on how coaching is going and learn ways we can continue to develop the program. Focus Groups took place via slack message questions and The Student Experience Team is now working on synthesizing the data to incorporate program changes and updates. For questions regarding our Coaching Program, reach out to [Megan.dias@makeschool.com](mailto:Megan.dias@makeschool.com).


### **[CoWork:](https://docs.makeschool.com/institutional-plan/?mc_cid=0969df180a&mc_eid=101923c956#/student-affairs/student-experience?id=cowork)**

CoWork is a coworking environment for students to work with their peers, get unblocked by TAs and staff, and collaborate on assignments. CoWork occurs on Mondays and Wednesdays at 1:30-2:30PM PT at [make.sc/cowork-zoom](http://make.sc/cowork-zoom) each week. Depending on student needs and availability, a third weekly session may be offered at the end of the term.  In addition to technical support, Megan and Casey are available at CoWork to provide career services support to students who need help with their resumes, LinkedIn profiles, portfolios, interview prep, etc. Students are encouraged to attend whether or not they need help on something in particular. However, if a student is on a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan), they are required to attend at least one session per week. Cowork is managed by Lisa Tran and Ian Birnham. For questions about CoWork, please reach out to [Lisa.Tran@makeschool.com](mailto:Lisa.Tran@makeschool.com).

Megan will continue to attend CoWork on Mondays to provide Career Services support on resume reviews, interview prep, and other workshops on best practices for job/internship search. 


### **[Student JEDI (Justice, Equity, Diversity, Inclusion) Council:](https://docs.makeschool.com/institutional-plan/?mc_cid=0969df180a&mc_eid=101923c956#/student-affairs/student-experience?id=student-jedi-justice-equity-diversity-inclusion-council)**

Our Student JEDI (Justice, Equity, Diversity, & Inclusion) Council focuses on student-facing initiatives related to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. The group meets a few times a month to brainstorm ideas and develop initiatives to support a diverse student body. The most recent projects being adding pronouns to slack profiles and an “All Hands on Deck” initiative to check in with all students to ensure all are supported towards a positive college experience. All students are invited to participate in this group, if interested in joining feel free to join the #student-jedi-council channel on Slack.

We also currently have a variety of SRGs (Student Resource Groups) to support JEDI initiatives such as the Wom*n of Make School Group, Black Student Committee, and various events hosted throughout each term to support DEI. We are also focusing our efforts on enrolling more students from underrepresented communities and also have this reflected in our employees and new hires. As part of our accreditation process, we will be growing our board and are committed to bringing on new members who are from diverse communities. For questions about JEDI initiatives, contact [Valdine@makeschool.com](mailto:Valdine@makeschool.com).

Term 3 Update: Students JEDI council members took the lead on advertising JEDI events such as ‘Intro to Algorithmic Justice’ and JEDI Reading groups. They also participated in the reading groups with Make School faculty and staff. Students reported that they enjoy reading groups because it allows them to build connections with Make School's staff members while further educating themselves on issues that impact the school and community.

Term 4 Update: Student JEDI council members will work on and deploy a cultural newsletter by the end of Term 4. The newsletter's goal is to spark curiosity and awareness about different cultures within the Make School community and beyond, share resources/upcoming events, and share personal insights and stories.

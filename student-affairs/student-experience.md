# Student Experience

*Staff area owner and author: Megan Dias (Student Experience Manager)*

_The Student Experience section covers all student facing programs, initiatives, and events owned and executed by the Student Experience Team (Megan, Lisa, Valdine)._

### School-wide Events:

The Student Experience Team hosts various school-wide events throughout the year to enhance the community. Below are some of the key annual events all students participate in.

**Orientation:** Orientation occurs each August and welcomes new students (incoming juniors) and returning students (seniors). The goals of Orientation are: 1) Build a sense of community, 2) Acclimate juniors to Make School and college life, and 3) Encourage seniors to show up as leaders and mentors and reflect on what was learned over the course of the past year. At the end of the Orientation, we gather feedback via a survey to continue to enhance the program each year. In the future, we would like to have student Orientation Leaders help in the planning and execution of orientation sessions.

**Graduation**: We recognize our graduates via a Graduation Celebration to honor all of their accomplishments and achievements. This year, we’ve held 2 graduations via zoom, with our third graduation coming up on Saturday, December 12th. We invite current students, staff, alumni and families to attend. The celebration includes speeches from students and staff, as well as time to congratulate the graduates with special gifts and a toast.

**Demo Night:** This is an annual event typically hosted in April, with the goal of connecting students to industry professionals by having students showcase projects they’ve developed during the Intensive Week. In the past, Demo Night has resulted in students getting internships and job offers, as well as enhancing skill-sets such as communication and talking about how they built their technical project. As we move forward in the remote world, we will figure out what this event (or a similar event) can look like to be most effective online.

**Career Fair:** In January 2020 we hosted our first ever Career Fair, where we invited 10+ companies to talk to students about open internships and jobs, as well as hosted speed mentoring, resume review, and interview practice. Students learned how to talk to recruiters, as well as enhance their understanding of hiring best practices. Student Experience will be partnering with the Outcomes Team to determine what this will look like in the future as we continue to operate remotely.

**Student led Town Halls:** In the past, we’ve held student-led Town Halls centered around a particular topic. These have been scheduled in response to Student Council requests or when determined necessary by the Dean and facilitated by Student Council members.

### Peer Mentors:

Peer Mentors consist of seniors mentoring juniors in various areas to enhance their overall experience. Both mentors and mentees apply to be part of the program. Mentorship categories are both technical and non-technical and include: helping with coding problems, being an International Student, scoping projects, goal setting, transitioning to Make School, being a Student of Color, and specific help based on individual concentration. Peer Mentors have 2-3 mentees and meet and/or chat frequently based on personal schedules. For questions regarding Peer Mentors, please contact [Lisa.tran@makeschool.com](mailto:Lisa.tran@makeschool.com).

### Student Council:

Student Council exists to be the voice of the student body to share concerns and suggestions on how to improve processes and the overall student experience. Each year, students are self-nominated and then voted in by their peers to act as a liaison between Make School students and staff. Student Council includes representatives from both the junior and senior class. For questions regarding Student Council, contact [Megan.dias@makeschool.com](mailto:Megan.dias@makeschool.com).

**Event Coordinators:** Students are invited to be Student Event Coordinators to plan events for all students to attend. Examples of past events include Trivia nights, movie nights, game nights, and Spirit Week. The Event Coordinators meet a few times a month and execute events they think the student body would be the most excited about. All students are invited to participate in the planning meetings and events! Check out our #event-coordinators slack channel if interested. For questions regarding Event Coordinators, reach out to [Lisa.tran@makeschool.com](mailto:Lisa.tran@makeschool.com).

### Student Clubs:

Students are encouraged to create and lead their own interest-based clubs as a way for them to connect outside of the classroom. This also creates opportunities for students to develop their leadership skills. Club registration opens at the beginning of each term. For more information on clubs, check out the [Clubs Program Structure](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12PJfcOiU1pjHkHi8YVIWDUXUVeBtnqQx5t2tf3--7Mo/edit?usp=sharing).  A full list of active clubs can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yLftM-3lk9ptSEhuttc8PiDu5KYZju2IW7s6oPSvnlU/edit?usp=sharing).  For questions regarding clubs, please reach out to [Lisa.tran@makeschool.com](mailto:Lisa.tran@makeschool.com).

### Coaching:

Coaching is designed to support students through building 1:1 connections with staff. Coaches provide guidance, accountability, and mentorship for students as they progress through Make School’s program. Each student selects a coach and meets with their coach 1:1 throughout their time at Make School at least twice per 7 week term. The program has recently been improved by implementing focus group feedback from both students and staff. Coaching is meant to be non-technical support and success is measured by end of term feedback surveys. For questions regarding our Coaching Program, reach out to [Megan.dias@makeschool.com](mailto:Megan.dias@makeschool.com).

### CoWork:

CoWork is a coworking environment for students to work with their peers, get unblocked by TAs and staff, and collaborate on assignments. CoWork occurs on Tuesdays and Thursdays each week. Depending on student needs and availability, a third weekly session may be offered at the end of the term. Career support is provided on Thursdays. Students are encouraged to attend whether or not they need help on something in particular. However, if a student is on a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan), they are required to attend at least one session per week. Cowork is managed by Lisa Tran and Ian Birnham. For questions about CoWork, please reach out to [Lisa.Tran@makeschool.com](mailto:Lisa.Tran@makeschool.com). 


### Student JEDI (Justice, Equity, Diversity, Inclusion) Council:

Our Student JEDI (Justice, Equity, Diversity, & Inclusion) Council focuses on student-facing initiatives related to justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion. The group meets a few times a month to brainstorm ideas and develop initiatives to support a diverse student body. The most recent projects being adding pronouns to slack profiles and an “All Hands on Deck” initiative to check in with all students to ensure all are supported towards a positive college experience. All students are invited to participate in this group, if interested in joining feel free to join the #student-jedi-council channel on Slack.

We also currently have a variety of SRGs (Student Resource Groups) to support JEDI initiatives such as the Wom*n of Make School Group, Black Student Committee, and various events hosted throughout each term to support DEI. We are also focusing our efforts on enrolling more students from underrepresented communities and also have this reflected in our employees and new hires. As part of our accreditation process, we will be growing our board and are committed to bringing on new members who are from diverse communities. For questions about JEDI initiatives, contact Valdine@makeschool.com.


### Staff Who’s Who 

[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kglc066N2kefkJ5lOIHMmP0_TlWjwil7b1JhR4u45vM/edit) exists for students to understand which staff member to reach out to for specific questions and/or expertise. Note that this doc is currently a high level overview, and we are in the process of adding more specifics for an easier navigation. It is kept up to date.


### Community Covenant 

The Community Covenant is co-created by each class during orientation and memorializes community norms agreed upon by the students.

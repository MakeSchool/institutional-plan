## JEDI Council Mission Statement

Make School pledges to support initiatives that increase and maintain justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion for all students at Make School, and in particular those students for whom creating safe spaces in tech is of utmost importance. To do this work, we have formed the JEDI Council at Make School - an organization that will serve as an accountability body that can push Make school towards becoming an even more diverse and inclusive community. Below, you can find the JEDI Council Charter. As we evolve the JEDI Council and its charter over the next few months, we will be posting updates to this page.

## JEDI Council Charter

### Objective

The JEDI Council is an accountability body formed by a group of volunteer staff at Make School. Our objective is to ensure the principles of Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) are upheld at Make School - by each individual as well as our collective community.

It is the JEDI Council's job to: (a) make policy and program recommendations regarding inclusive and diverse approaches to education and administration; (b) examine programs, activities, and practices to surface areas where Justice, Equity, Diversity, or Inclusion are lacking and support/execute solutions; and (c) hold Make School accountable with regards to our JEDI goals through regular, cross-team accountability review.

### Participation

One of the most important elements of the JEDI Council is cross-team participation. At least one member from each team, including SLT, will be a core member of the Council, with the option to rotate members in/out for more participation opportunities.

The Council will meet twice per month to track each team's JEDI Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) and surface areas of opportunity for more JEDI policy or programming. The Council will also work on special independent projects and initiatives (outlined below) to help advance JEDI goals at Make School.

### Operation & Initiatives

#### JEDI Speakers Initiative
This initiative is meant to bring expert individuals to the Make School community to share their knowledge about JEDI topics, often specifically through the lens of technology.

#### Cultural Celebrations Calendar
This initiative is meant to create celebration and knowledge sharing about all the cultures represented within the Make School community.

#### JEDI Reading Group
The JEDI Reading Group is an optional space for the Make School community to learn about the many ways systemic injustice has impacted individuals, communities, and the country over time. The learning is objective-based and aims to be actionable. Each month, the group focuses on a particular topic to delve into more deeply. Examples of past learning topics include restorative interventions, allyship, and analysis of anti-racist initiatives at peer institutions.

### Other Committees Supported by the JEDI Council

*Purpose*
* Why we created/joined this Council:

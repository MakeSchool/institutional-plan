# Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion

*Staff area owner and author: Komal Desai (Communications Manager and JEDI Council Member)*

Make School pledges to support initiatives that increase and maintain justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion for all students at Make School, and in particular those students for whom creating safe spaces in tech is of utmost importance. To do this work, we have formed the JEDI Council at Make School - an organization that will serve as an accountability body that can push Make school towards becoming an even more diverse and inclusive community. Below, you can find the JEDI Council Charter. As we evolve the JEDI Council and its charter over the next few months, we will be posting updates to this page.

## JEDI Council Charter

### Objective

The JEDI Council is an accountability body formed by a group of volunteer staff at Make School. Our objective is to ensure the principles of Justice, Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (JEDI) are upheld at Make School - by each individual as well as our collective community.

It is the JEDI Council's job to: (a) make policy recommendations regarding inclusive and diverse approaches to education and administration; (b) examine programs, activities, and practices to surface areas where Justice, Equity, Diversity, or Inclusion are lacking; and (c) hold Make School accountable with regards to our JEDI goals through regular, cross-team accountability review panels.


### Participation

One of the most important elements of the JEDI Council is cross-team participation. At least one member from each team, including SLT, will be a core member of the Council, with the option to rotate members in/out for more participation opportunities.

A preliminary version of the Council will meet initially about twice per month to discuss and finalize our objectives, Council members, and initiatives. After the core Council is finalized, the Council will meet regularly to conduct panel reviews with each team to ensure adherence to the team's JEDI OKRs. The Council will also work on special independent projects and initiatives (see initial ideas below) to help advance JEDI goals at Make School.


### Operation & Initiatives

Ideas for initial JEDI Council projects/initiatives:
* Finalizing the structure and responsibilities of the JEDI Council
* Creation of company-wide JEDI OKRs to include in rubrics for all team members
* Holding each team (including SLT) accountable for JEDI goals and metrics
* Interviews of D&I consulting firms 
* Support with hiring a full-time, staff JEDI resource at Make School who will also help continue to evolve the JEDI Council
* Creation of a student-facing/encompassing JEDI subcommittee that will work on the following initiatives:
  1.  Supporting JEDI StuEx work including helping define a role and launch the search for a dedicated, student-facing JEDI hire
  2.  Creation of ongoing learning sessions
  3.  Integration of JEDI topics into S&L courses
  4.  Ensuring that the interaction between staff and students aligns with our overall mission of creating an equitable and inclusive learning environment

#### JEDI Reading Group
The JEDI Reading Group is an optional space for members of the Make School staff to learn about the many ways systemic injustice has impacted individuals, communities, and the country over time. The learning is objective-based and aims to be actionable. Each month, the group focuses on a particular topic to delve into more deeply. Examples of past learning topics include restorative interventions, allyship, and analysis of anti-racist initiatives at peer institutions.

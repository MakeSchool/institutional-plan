# Student Council

*Student area owner and author: Student Council*

In Term 3, Student Council initiated school-wide Don Rags, which was an opt-in professional & personal development opportunity for students to receive verbal feedback from instructors and coaches. 

**How did it work?** Students chose 2 instructors and their coach to join a 15 minute zoom call to “be a fly on the wall” (camera off, on mute) while staff spoke about the student as if they were not present. After each staff member spoke, the student had the opportunity to chime in based on what was discussed and together, decide on actionable next steps to continue to grow professionally.

**What was participation like?** Students submitted a form selecting who from Make School staff they wanted in their session. 15 students (6 seniors, 9 juniors) signed up and all 15 followed through by showing up to their scheduled session. 11 instructors and 9 coaches participated.

**What was the feedback?** Student Council created a feedback survey and 9/15 students responded. 88.9% (of submitted feedback 9/15) said by participating in Don Rags, they received feedback that they otherwise would have not received. Feedback was shared in an honest and kind manner, with students commenting on it overall being a great experience. Students also mentioned that a lot of the feedback received was positive, and they were preparing for and assuming some of it would be a bit more harsh. 88.9% of respondents said they would absolutely (5/5) recommend this experience to other students.

**Key takeaways:** By capping this opportunity at 50 students and having sign-ups be on a first-come, first-served basis, it really helped with the logistics, and ensuring students received a few of their top choice participants. By having students opt in, students were both mentally prepared to hear feedback and ready to continue to develop professionally by creating actionable next steps as a result of the conversation. If we choose to conduct Don Rags in the future, there’s 2 things we would do differently, including: 1) Ensure the sign-up form is clear by having students choose instructors they most closely work with, and 2) Better preparing students for the potential emotional aftermath the session could possibly create.

**Conclusion:** Students who participated found this to be valuable and thanked Make School for this opportunity.

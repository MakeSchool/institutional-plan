*Note!* This issue tracker should only be used for actionable and constructive feedback that impacts Make School as an organization or any given group of stakeholders (staff, students, etc.). If you encounter a situation which is highly personal (i.e: which only applies to your individual situation, or which you do not want shared publicly), and you're not sure who to reach out to, please contact a member of Student Experience for guidance.

*Additional Note:* This issue tracker can not be used for emergent or urgent requests, or complaints regarding [Code of Conduct](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a1i2jwXqx__URpWvUf8z8E9iwcdJ05QsPnbjs7Z83Us/preview#heading=h.xlozhda52bcz) violations. Should one of these issues arise, please fill out the [Student Reporting Form](http://make.sc/student-reporting-form) or reach out to a member of Student Experience or another staff member you trust via Slack or email.

## Issues

Additions to this segment of the repository are extraordinarily welcome, and encouraged. With the goal of constant growth and experience, Make School as an organization is dedicated to iteration and improvement. As you consider issues you may have or ideas for improvement, please follow the below guidelines to ensure that we can ensure it is taken into consideration:

1. **What is an 'Issue'?**

- Put simply, an "issue" is any piece of actionable or constructive feedback about facets of Make School which you would like to see improved. "Issues" can be in regards to:

  1. Curriculum
  2. Student Experience
  3. Academic Support
  4. Organization-wide Processes
  5. Concentrations
  6. Or any combination of the above, or anything we've missed, so long as it:

      1. Would improve the organization as a whole or the experience of a whole group of stakeholders (i.e: staff, or students)
      2. Is constructive (i.e: not an insult, rant, etc.)

2. **How do I submit an Issue?**

- In order to submit an issue, navigate to the [issues](https://github.com/MakeSchool/institutional-plan/issues) segment of our repository (if you aren't there already!) and click on "New Issue" - it's a bright green button in the upper right-hand corner of the page!

- Select the category your issue falls under! If you aren't quite sure, pick the one that you think is the closest.

- Fill out our issues template (it will autopopulate in the body of the issue) with your specific information, and add a descriptive title.

  Examples of good titles:

  1. "Outline of Proposed Events for Spring 2021"
  2. "Concern with Current Lesson Plan for Async JavaScript, BEW 1.3"

  We want to know what your concern or idea is as soon as we check out the title! This will help moderators of the Issues forum comb through and find high priority issues, or things that are more quickly implemented, so that we can allocate time to your ideas as efficiently as possible!

- Provide a clear and concise description of your concern or idea. Think about implementation, and try to consider "side effects". This isn't to make this process difficult for you, rather, to give you the chance to sell your idea or concern so that we understand how to proceed with fixing or working on it!

- What is your intended outcome? Think about this like a coding problem - what behavior do you *want* to see? If you're proposing an event, what would you like the benefit to be? More chances to socialize or network? To strengthen our community?

  *Note*: There aren't really wrong answers. This is another step to ensuring that your idea or concern can be addressed, or so that we can point you in the right direction if it's something we are already working on or doing.

  With that being said, this is a chance for you to consider the desired outcome, and recognize whether what you're asking for is really the "root" of your concern. For example, if you request a curriculum change because a class feels difficult, it's possible that what's needed is more TA support. If we understand the desired outcome, we can have a dialogue to get to the root of any problems we may find.

3. **What happens next?**

Once you've submitted an issue, a member of Student Council will tag it, and flag the corresponding department head or staff member. The department your issue corresponds to (i.e: Student Experience, or Curriculum) will take some time to consider what's being asked, and ask clarifying questions. If your issue is something we can move forward with fixing or implementing, you will be provided with a point of contact and an approximate "due date" at which this issue should be resolved, or by which you can follow up to check in.

Clarifying questions may be asked in the thread, so pay attention to your Github notifications to stay informed!

4. **What if my issue came from a feedback form?**

A very important part of *Issues* is that they might not be directly posted by you, but you might want to check in here to see about a concern that you raised as a part of mid or end-of-term feedback forms.

If this is the case, we'll send out notifications to students via Slack to update the student body which concerns from feedback forms have been posted, along with their ID #'s so that you can follow the thread and stay informed on what's happening with your feedback.

5. **I have more questions, who do I ask?**

If you have questions about this process, reach out to a member of Student Council! They'll either be able to answer your specific questions, or direct you to the appropriate staff member who can!

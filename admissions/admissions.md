# Admissions

*Staff area owner and author: Emily Sheldon (Head of Admissions)*

### Updates for 2020-2021 application cycle

Based on feedback from EY20 applicants and admissions staff, we implemented the following changes



*   1:1 admissions interview is no longer required for all applicants 
*   Application fee for international applicants


### Philosophy

At Make School, we see the admissions process more as a coaching opportunity rather than a process during which we simply judge students on their skills and experiences. Our mission at Make School is to ensure that every student gains the abilities needed to succeed in reaching their goals and aspirations in life - and this mission starts during the admissions process.


### Selection Process and Criteria

The selection process takes a holistic view of your experiences and achievements - both inside and outside of the classroom. Read more about our process and application requirements on our [website](https://www.makeschool.com/computer-science-degree/admissions).

Generally speaking, we are looking for:



*   A pattern of hard work. This could be in an academic or non-academic setting.
*   Involvement in projects, activities, organizations. This could be a hackathon, volunteer work, student council, community projects, sport teams, or academic societies.
*   Character traits such as teamwork, collaboration, kindness, emotional intelligence, resilience, and an interest in software engineering.
*   While we value prior programming experience, we do not require it. In fact, our admissions process was designed to welcome programmers of all levels.

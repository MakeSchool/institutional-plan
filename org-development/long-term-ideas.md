# Long Term Ideas

*Staff area owner and author: Ashu Desai (Founder)*

**We have a few ideas that we're interested in exploring in the mid-long term:**

- Launching a fully online degree and pathways for students to earn or complete their degrees while working.
- Expanding Mastery Based Learning and Competency Based Accreditation, enabling more self-paced and flipped classroom courses.
- Teaching computer science courses on campuses of more colleges (as we are at Dominican) to help modernize existing institutions.
- Exploring modular credentials, allowing people to earn vocational certificates and associates degrees on the path to a full bachelors degree, and allowing people with existing credentials to transfer in.
- Adding more specializations within computer science, such as design and human-computer interaction, robotics, and cognition and artificial intelligence. This will largely be determined based on student and employer demand.
- Launching new majors beyond computer science, likely still computer adjacent. The leading contenders are computational biology and data science for climate.
- Building a masters program to better serve older students.

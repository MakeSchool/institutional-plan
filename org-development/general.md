# General Make School Updates

*Staff area owner and author: Jeremy Rossmann (Founder)*

## May 2020

Dear Make School community - 2020 is off to a fast start. We are grateful that California is finding success in the battle against COVID-19 while recognizing that much of the world is not as fortunate.

We are expecting to be back on campus this fall, though will continue to offer a fully remote learning option for students who need it. We're excited to be with you in person again!

Our team has been heads down preparing for the site visit with our accreditor that happened last week (May 5-7th), so our general org updates are a bit lighter this cycle. We will be sharing more information about the accreditation process and general updates soon.

Best, The Make School Team
